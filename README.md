# About Me 
Hi, I'm Jen.
- - -
I have an **English** degree from [Alverno College](https://www.alverno.edu/), with two minors:

* *Social Science* 
* *Philosophy*

Having very few opportunities in those fields without Masters or Doctorate degrees, I decided to switch things up and get into web development, since I've been doing it for more than 15 years on a small scale. 

### Here's to a new career!
